## 👤 Author
**Name:** MOHAMMED MISHAL P _
**Institute Email:** me24i1014@iiitdm.ac.in _
**Submission Date:** September 5, 2025

## 📚 Prerequisites
- MATLAB (installed via MathWorks account with institute email)
- Completed MATLAB Onramp course
- Basic understanding of matrix operations and plotting in MATLAB

## 🎯 Task Objectives
This recruitment task evaluates:
- Ability to learn MATLAB in a short timeframe

## 💻 Problems and Solutions

### Problem 1: Matrix Manipulation
**Objective:** Create and modify a 5x5 matrix based on positional conditions.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize a random 5x5 matrix
2. Apply transformation rules:
   - Diagonal elements (i=j): value = i² + j²
   - Lower triangle (i>j): value = i² + j
   - Upper triangle (i<j): value = i + j²
3. Calculate and display the sum of all elements

**Key Concepts Used:**
- Matrix indexing
- Nested loops
- Conditional statements

### Problem 2: Color-Coded Matrix Visualization
**Objective:** Generate a 10x10 matrix with color visualization based on value ranges.

**Algorithm:**
1. Create a 10x10 matrix with random integers (1-100)
2. Map values to colors:
   - 1-33: Blue (1)
   - 34-66: Green (2)
   - 67-100: Red (3)
3. Create a color-coded plot

**Key Concepts Used:**
- Random number generation
- Matrix visualization
- Color mapping
- Image plotting

### Problem 3: Trigonometric Function Plotting
**Objective:** Plot sine, cosine, and tangent functions using subplots.

**Algorithm:**
1. Generate X values from -2π to 2π with π/2 intervals
2. Calculate sin(X), cos(X), and tan(X)
3. Create subplots for each function
4. Add proper labels, titles, and legends

**Key Concepts Used:**
- `linspace` function
- Subplot creation
- Trigonometric functions
- Plot formatting and labeling

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MMP241007/SCCMATLAB-TASK-1.git
   cd SCCMATLAB-TASK-1
   ```

2. **Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory**

3. **Run individual problems:**
   ```matlab
   % For Problem 1
   cd Problem_1
   problem1
   
   % For Problem 2
   cd ../Problem_2
   problem2
   
   % For Problem 3
   cd ../Problem_3
   problem3
   ```

## 📊 Expected Outputs
